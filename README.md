## Overview

The **Human Value Detector** is an interactive web application designed to analyze text and predict associated human values. Leveraging a **DeBERTa-based** sequence classification model, this tool identifies and visualizes various human values present in the input text. Whether you're conducting research, building applications that require value analysis, or simply curious about the underlying values in your statements, this tool offers a straightforward solution.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes the `tum-nlp/Deberta_Human_Value_Detector` model for reliable value detection.
- **Threshold Filtering**: Only displays values exceeding a specified confidence threshold.
- **Visualization**: Presents predictions in an easy-to-understand bar chart.
- **Extensible**: Easily add more features or integrate into larger projects.


### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
